## Optimal guidance at work


1. A volley of Hamas rockets is fired from Gaza strip towards Israeli cities.
2. Ground radars detect typical signal returns of launches.
3. Being uncontrollable nor maneuverable, flight trajectory of the rockets can be estimated in a good approximation.
4. After filtration, measurements are fused into a single state vector, used for the GNC initial conditions.
5. When optimal conditions are met, [interceptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Dome) are launched, while continuously computing the dynamic pursuit.
